VULN: IDOR (Broken Access Control)

1) Profile IDOR
- Endpoint: GET /profile/view?id=<user_id>
- Hint: Try requesting another user's profile by their user_id (returned at registration). The endpoint returns profile details when VULN_MODE=true.

2) Messages IDOR (if present)
- Endpoint: GET /messages/:userId
- Hint: Try requesting messages for another username (e.g., /messages/userA) while logged in as a different user.

Instructions:
- Enable VULN_MODE=true in your local .env for testing (only run locally).
- Install jq: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y jq`
- In one terminal, start the server, and in another terminal, run `chmod +x test-idor.sh` and `./test-idor.sh`.
- You will get the user IDs in the terminal. 


VULN: Stored XSS
- Look at the chat.html file 
    - Notice there's an escapeHtml() function defined... but is it being used everywhere?

- Try sending a message with HTML tags or JavaScript code.
