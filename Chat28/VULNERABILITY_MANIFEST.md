### Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
**Location:** routes/profile.js → `/profile/view?id=<user_id>`

**Description:**  
The endpoint allows any user (or even unauthenticated request) to access another user’s profile information by supplying their `user_id` as a query parameter. There is no authorization check verifying whether the requester is allowed to access the resource.

**Impact:** Attackers can enumerate or access sensitive user data belonging to other accounts.

**Example:** GET `/profile/view?id=654abc123...` returns private data for another user.

**Secure Fix:** Require authentication and compare the authenticated user’s `user_id` with the requested one before returning any data.



### Stored XSS - Client Side
**Location:** public/chat.js, `displayPublicMessage()` and `displayPrivateMessage()` functions

**Behaviour:** 
User message content is rendered using innerHTML without sanitisation

**Learning Objective:** Demonstrate stored cross-site scripting attacks

**Label:** // INTENTIONAL VULNERABILITY: Removed `escapeHtml()` to allow XSS
